Lending Club dataset using Gradient Boosting


1. Pre-processing: handling missing values, choosing necessary attributes, transforming categorical into binary values.

2. Applied gradient boosting and tried to achieve best accuracy, precision and re-call and the hyper parameters which lead to it.

3. Studied the effect of increasing number of trees in the classifier.

4. Compared the final best performance against a simple decision tree built using information gain.
